### Separation of Concerns:

| Layer	| Responsibility | Why Itâ€™s Used |
| ------| -------------- | ------------- |
| Model | Represents database tables (Employee, Person, Appointment).	| Encapsulates data structure.
| Repository | Handles data access (queries, CRUD operations). | Separates data logic from business logic.
| Service|Contains business logic (e.g., validate employee before adding to DB).|Centralizes business rules and promotes reusability.
| Controller|Handles HTTP requests (maps routes, returns API responses).|Separates API logic from business logic.
| Interface | Defines contracts for repositories. |	Enables dependency injection, flexibility, and testing.
